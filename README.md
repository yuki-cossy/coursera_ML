# *coursera_ML*
 This is my first ever github repository, so I leave a celebration comment here yay! Congrats!  
 This repository is exclusively for my own study and I doubt there's much to see here.  
 All the materials are for the Machine Learning class on Coursera from Andrew Ng at Stanford University.
